# Introduction
This overview outlines an approach to developing documentation plans in consultation with development teams, release management, quality assurance, and other stakeholders. This metaplan provides some ways of framing conversations around what documentation should be produced and how, and is not intended to be exhaustive or prescriptive. 

More than a description of what documentation is to be produced, a documentation plan describes processes for creating, reviewing, and maintaining documentation. Processes should be introduced gradually, should align closely with current and best practices, and should provide mechanisms for evaluation and review. 

A traditional documentation plan targets specific deliverables for a specific software release. Just as modern software is, generally, in a mode of continuous release, a modern documentation plan describes the processes and deliverables that will allow documentation to be continuously developed and released along with the software.
