# Plan for Bug and Issue Tracking

A process should be put in place for development and quality teams (and others) to request enhancements and identify issues in the documentation. Ideally, this should be integrated in the whatever system is used to identify software enhancements and issues. When documentation issues are addressed, a link should be established between the issue and the commit/contribution provided by the documentation team.

A process for identifying which software bugs are addressed within a release so they can be referenced in release notes is required. A way of providing descriptions of issues and solutions suitable for publication within release notes must be part of the bug tracking system.

Some product bugs may be converted into or linked to documentation issues - this occurs for example when a known limitation or work-around must be documented.
