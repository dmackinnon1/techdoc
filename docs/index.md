# Technical Documentation Metaplan

Documents collected here provide a view of some considerations for planning effective documentation plans.

A key theme throughout is that documentation should not be created outside of the other processes of software development. Ideally,the documentation team works closely with other contributors to ensure that documentation is integrated directly into or alongside the development, testing, and release life-cycles of the software itself.
