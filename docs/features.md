# Develop a Process for Documenting New Features

A procedure should allow for identifying which new features or API to be documented at early stages in the development cycle. This should happen at the level of identifying new API, but also identifying new stories or usec-ases that should be documented. As PM and Dev develop user stories, those that should be considered for new documentation or documentation revisions should be flagged as early as possible.
