# Plan to Work Closely with Audiences

It should be noted that audiences for technical documents include end-users and integrators (API consumers), but also QA teams, support teams, product management, and development teams themselves. 

The development team, for example, will use technical documentation to help onboard new team members, but also to help establish a language and examples that help all team members understand and talk about the product they are developing. Good documentation can be instrumental in helping identify new features, write clearer specifications, define test plans, etc.

Although documentation is consumed by many audiences, it is important to keep the primary audience in mind (typically users and integrators). Internal teams such as product management, development, and quality assurance, may provide the most feedback and review, but may be secondary audiences with a very different perspective than the primary audience. Ways must be found to engage external and user audiences to provide input for the development and enhancement of the documentation.
