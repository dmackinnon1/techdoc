# Identify Key Concepts and Terminology

Clarifying basic assumptions, clearing up jargon, and defining core concepts can help make API documents and higher level documentation clear, concise, and consistent. From API documents and use-case overviews, it should be easy to navigate to simple diagrams illustrating core concepts and high level overviews of frequently used terms. 

Consultation with development, architects, and product management can help identify what the core concepts are behind the software and what key terminology should be defined.
