# Senior Technical Writer Role

In addition to the production of high quality documentation, new documentation projects require planning, the establishment of processes for production, review, and publication, as well as ongoing capacity building. Consequently, the senior technical writer will:

- *Create a documentation plan in collaboration with the development team.* Working with development team, the senior technical writer will establish an overall documentation plan that describes deliverables and timelines. The plan will describe priorities in terms of the functional areas to be documented, the types of documentation to be provided, and the intended audiences.

- *Implement mechanisms for managing documentation and making it accessible.* Through consultation with other documentation teams and/or review of existing documentation practices, the senior technical writer will develop and oversee processes for managing documentation workflows and mechanisms for making documentation accessible internally and externally. 

- *Understand and work with the development cycle and release schedule.* In collaboration with the development team, the senior technical writer will establish and oversee processes for integrating the documentation schedule with the development release schedule. This process must ensure that documentation reflects released software versions, identifies new APIs and features, and also identifies any deprecations and known issues.

- *Allow for the continuous development and improvement of the documentation.* Together with development team and others, the senior technical writer will establish and follow a process for reviewing documentation for overall quality and identifying documentation defects and enhancements

- *Facilitate contributions and reviews from others.* The senior technical writer will help establish processes for others to contribute to documentation writing and review. The established process must allow developers and technical writers to effectively contribute to the ongoing development of the documentation, providing contributions and reviews for both released and unreleased versions of the documentation. The senior technical writer will also produce style and contribution guides, and provide training on the review and contribution process.

- *Understand the software.* The senior technical writer will become familiar with the essential software architecture, with the primary use-cases of the APIs and services that are being documented, and with planned features and enhancement. Continuous learning will be an essential part of the documentation process. The senior technical writer will work with development teams to identify processes for development to identify new features and services that will require documentation for specific releases.

- *Work with testers and quality assurance.* The senior technical writer will work with quality assurance teams to ensure that the documentation correctly describes APIs and services, and that any code samples or examples are correct (and tested), and that the documentation reflect best practices for the use of the software. Any current issues or defects requiring documentation will be identified by development and quality assurance teams.

- *Understand users.* The senior technical writer must understand who the consumers of the software and its documentation are, and ensure that documentation is accessible and presented appropriately. This will require consultation with development, and possibly other stakeholders (other development teams, support, etc.) The senior technical writer will establish mechanisms for providing feedback on documentation in terms of requests for new documentation, identification of  defects, and feedback on overall quality and usability.

- *Produce high quality documentation.* The senior technical writer will be responsible for producing documentation which may include: 
* API documentation, describing specific functions, interfaces, etc.;
* How-to guides, written to address user scenarios;
* Code samples showing how to use the APIs;
* Best-practice guides for developers; 
* Documentation required to meet Privacy, Legal, or other Corporate policy requirements;
* Release notes.

- *Produce documentation in a variety of formats.* Documentation may be directly consumed by users or may be used in other processes to transform the formatting and presentation of the documentation. Consequently, documentation may be required to be produced in presentation formats such as HTML or Markdown, or in structured formats, possibly including JSON, XML, YAML, etc.

- *Use a variety of media.* In addition to documentation presented on web pages and documents, the senior technical writer will produce a variety of visuals including diagrams, charts, etc. and may author presentations, videos, and blog posts.
