# Define Processes for Contributing to Documentation

If there are embedded source code elements that are used to generate documentation, the dev team must be aware of these elements and understand the processes used to generate them.

If contributing to the same repository as the development team, writers must follow established practices for contributing to the shared repo. If contributing to independent repositories, the writing team must establish sensible guidelines that are inline with development best practice. 

Contributions to documentation in the code source repository and in independent repositories should be version controlled and contributions should be validated using a continuous integration process. Processes for larger scale reviews must be put in place, as well as processes for reviewing at the contribution level.
