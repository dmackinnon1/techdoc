# Identify Connections with Quality Assurance and Testing

Documentation requires its own quality assurance and testing, but should also be used as part of product quality initiatives. Some possibilities in this area include:

Mechanisms for integrating API specifications directly into automated testing should be investigated.

For any code examples used in the documentation, work with development and QA to identify or provide a test case that exercises the example that has been documented. Where possible, have the test case identify where the code example is used in the documentation.

Mechanisms must be put in place for QA and testers to identify documentation enhancements and issues based on product testing.
