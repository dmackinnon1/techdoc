# What to Document
When developing a documentation plan, rather than setting out to provide exhaustive and comprehensive description of all available APIs or user interfaces, consider the following:

- Documentation should be treated like code, requiring iterative development, testing, and release management. 

- Documentation must be maintained - the more elaborate the documentation, the more expensive and difficult it is to maintain. 

- Documentation can help reduce risk, but can also expose additional risks.

The last point is particularly true for API documentation - once an API is documented, it is going to be (more widely) used. Once documented, API will be subjected to higher volumes of use, unexpected uses, and will begin to have other products and services depending on it.

These considerations recommend that a cautious, minimalist, and defensive approach be applied when considering what to document.
